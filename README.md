##  About Me
Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a 22 year old Spanish programmer and I'm going to tell you a little about myself. Since I was very young, my love for art was awakened in me.
All my life I studied arts, until I was 19 years old when I started to learn on my own about the world of programming. Then I entered a school and was able to continue studying about this wonderful world of programming. Somehow programming had now become my passion, I discovered how art and programming go hand in hand more than I thought, and today I'm still learning and eager to continue. 

I am a hard-working girl and I like to work in a team, I think that this way you learn a lot more and I may not be a great programmer, but I am a programmer with great habits.
Thank you very much for visiting my profile!
